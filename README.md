# Image-classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-

In this project we take the 15- scene classification data and train it using the  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to be able to classify images into 15 scenes. The scene classification data consists of a total of 4485 images of 15 scenes. We set aside 30% of the images for testing and use the remaining 3140 images in training the CNN. Apart from the 15- scene data we also use the MNIST dataset for classification using CNN. We resize the 15-scene dataset images to 32x32 and the MNIST dataset images to 28x28 for faster computation. The accuracy of the classification of both the datasets is found and compared. We use the ReLu activation function in the convolution layers and soft-max activation in the final fully connected layer.
